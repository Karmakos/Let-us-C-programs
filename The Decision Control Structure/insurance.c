amount cannot exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
(2) If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that
the sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand
and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh.
(3) If a personâ€™s health is poor and the person is between 25
and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male
